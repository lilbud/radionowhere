# Intro
This is a brief file discussing my thought process when picking recordings, as well as properly sorting and organizing files so that archive will list the files correctly.

# Project Goal
As mentioned, the point of this project is to get as many Bruce shows onto archive as possible. The initial goal is the "best" version of each show, which can be a bit subjective from person to person, but it's the only way to keep this project manageable to start. Otherwise it'll spiral and might never reach its intended goal. 

This is something I already do on my own, as I don't have the hard drive space currently for every single version of every single show. Many will take the opposite approach and attempt to collect *everything*, and that is fine for those who have the means to. Just that for me personally, and for the initial purpose of this project, it is not the goal.

# Quality is Subjective
Determining the "best" version of a show is fairly difficult. As one person might think a tape sounds incredible, and another might think it's crap. I judge quality based on how listenable it is. The point of collecting bootlegs for me is to eventually listen to them (I'm working on it I swear!). 

Of course, for some shows this isn't possible. Some shows only have one recording available, and if that single recording is from the nosebleeds while drunks are arguing around the taper, so be it. Not much can be done in that case. I might still keep it just to have a document of a show, and nothing more.

If this project was just limited to shows with only good quality tapes, it would max out at maybe 1000 shows (and that might be a bit high).

# Recording Type
In case of multiple high-quality recordings for each show. This is a light guideline to follow:
> SBD > IEM > FM Broadcast > AUD

It's not perfect, and not all tapes of a type are equal. The only way to determine if a recording is worth a damn is by listening to it. A soundboard can't always be assumed to sound incredible, but not all audience tapes are crap. Sometimes as mentioned, there might only be a single recording, and if it sucks oh well.
