# Intro
This is a brief file discussing my thought process when picking recordings, as well as properly sorting and organizing files so that archive will list the files correctly.

# Project Goal
As mentioned, the point of this project is to get as many Bruce shows onto archive as possible. The initial goal is the "best" version of each show, which can be a bit subjective from person to person, but it's the only way to keep this project manageable to start. Otherwise it'll spiral and might never reach its intended goal. 

This is something I already do on my own, as I don't have the hard drive space currently for every single version of every single show. Many will take the opposite approach and attempt to collect *everything*, and that is fine for those who have the means to. Just that for me personally, and for the initial purpose of this project, it is not the goal.

# Quality is Subjective
Determining the "best" version of a show is fairly difficult. As one person might think a tape sounds incredible, and another might think it's crap. I judge quality based on how listenable it is. The point of collecting bootlegs for me is to eventually listen to them (I'm working on it I swear!). 

Of course, for some shows this isn't possible. Some shows only have one recording available, and if that single recording is from the nosebleeds while drunks are arguing around the taper, so be it. Not much can be done in that case. I might still keep it just to have a document of a show, and nothing more.

If this project was just limited to shows with only good quality tapes, it would max out at maybe 1000 shows (and that might be a bit high).

# Recording Type
In case of multiple high-quality recordings for each show. This is a light guideline to follow:
> SBD > IEM > FM Broadcast > AUD

It's not perfect, and not all tapes of a type are equal. The only way to determine if a recording is worth a damn is by listening to it. A soundboard can't always be assumed to sound incredible, but not all audience tapes are crap. Sometimes as mentioned, there might only be a single recording, and if it sucks oh well.

# Lineage and Source
In short, when a tape has some info on the history of it, it'll be included in the item description. At the very least there will be a tracklist and maybe the person involved with releasing it. Many tapes might have absolutely no info attached, which sucks but not much can be done in that case.

The "Source" will be listed as the lineage if it is known, otherwise it'll just say "Audience" or "Soundboard"

# Filenames
For naming the various bootlegs, I've come up with a system that is a slightly modified version of the [etree naming standards](https://wiki.etree.org/index.php?page=NamingStandards). The basic format is as follows:
> bsYYYY-MM-DD-(early/late).rectype.source.fileformat/bitdepth

First part should be self-explanatory. "BS" is "Bruce Springsteen", then the date in ISO format.

If the tape belongs to an early or a late show, then that is included right after the date, separated by a hyphen.

Next is "rectype" or "recording type", the following should be used:
- sbd - soundboard
- aud - audience tape
- fm - fm broadcast
- pre-fm - pre-fm tape
- iem - in-ear monitor feed
- iem-aud - an iem and aud recording mixed together, usually called a matrix

if a recording is a "matrix" or mix of sources, then indicate that with the types split by hyphens.

Source is where the tape came from, as mentioned previously this isn't always known. Just whoever was involved in the tape as provided by the info file. If it is a "retail" release, then the name of the label followed by the catalog code if there is one. (cc974-76 - Crystal Cat Records Cat. 974-76). If the release belongs to a "series", then this can be listed here as well. (ntl-8 -> Nothing to Lose Vol. 8, recordings released by JEMS for the 77 lawsuit tour).
