## Intro
This document is attempt number two at a vague list of guidelines I am attempting to follow for this project. Now with the benefit of much hindsight having spent 3 months uploading my entire collection of boots onto archive.

## Project Goal
The goal of this project is to have a (hopefully) long-term repository of Bruce Springsteen bootlegs/concert tapes. The primary focus is to have the best copy of each show available as part of the project. Maybe eventually it'll open up to every version of every show, but 1 copy a show is an attainable enough goal for the time being. 

## Quality Note:
Determining the "best" version of a show is pretty difficult, and usually differs from person to person. One person might think a tape is great and another thinks it sounds like crap. For the purposes of this project, I'm going off of which version of a show sounds the best to me. One day I'll actually get around to listening to most of these shows, maybe.

In many cases, there is only one tape circulating for a given show. So, if the taper was in the nosebleeds and was surrounded by fighting drunks, oh well. Hopefully a better tape will make it out one day, but in the meantime nothing can be done about it. 

If I was to limit this project to only good tapes, it would maybe cap out at 1000 shows. And that number is me being generous.

## Naming
The guidelines for naming the bootlegs is a modified version of the etree naming standards. Those standards were developed in the late 90s/early 2000s. And it was simply a way to have a consistent naming standard for bootlegs being transferred/uploaded onto the early torrent trackers.

There are also the "extended guidelines", which are more common these days. These will include info on the taper/mics/hardware involved in the source recording.

This information isn't always known for Bruce tapes. Some bootlegs will only have the tapers name, others will be limited to the name of the retail label that released it. With this in mind, I used a modified version of these standards. Including as much info as reasonably possible. This format allows for easy identifying of recordings, while also not having folder names that cause issues with operating systems by being too long.

These two folder names are functionally equal:
> Bruce Springsteen 1992-06-20 Forum Di Assago - Milano, Italy (Two Of Us Master Series Volume 237)

> bs1992-06-20.aud.two-of-us-237.mjk5510.flac16

The basic form of the name is below:

``` bsYYYY-MM-DD-(early/late/note).rectype.source.fileformat/bitdepth```

### Date
If multiple shows on the same date circulate, then "early/late" can be added after the date. Otherwise just the YYYY-MM-DD date is fine.

### Recording Type
recording type is next, specifying the type of recording it is. Some of these are:
- Soundboard (SBD)
- Audience (AUD)
- In-Ear Monitor Feed (IEM)
- FM (FM Broadcast)
- Matrix/MTX (combination of two or more of the above)

There are many others which I'll go into detail on eventually.

### Source
This is the least strict part of the folder name, including the info on a recording. Some tapes have no info available, so this part would just be "unknown". Otherwise info on the taper/editor/release group/series can be listed here. People/groups are to be separated with periods. All spaces are replaced with hyphens. 

### File Format/Bit Depth
This one is easy, essentially the type of file in the folder. In most cases, this is FLAC, as is required by most trading sites. Sometimes this can be MP3 if it is a lossy source (like a webcast or tv broadcast).

After the type is bitdepth. Not really applicable for MP3 though it will usually be 320 or another lower value. For FLAC this will be either 16 or 24. 24bit recordings are basically just for transfers from the master recording. Any tape taken from a CD are 16bit. Even if it was from a master cassette, CD is capped at 16bit and 44.1khz. You can look up more info on this elsewhere on the internet.

# Conclusion
Congrats for getting here. This document is subject to change as the project evolves. At some point I'll write up pages on the various sources, as well as tagging and organizing folders for inclusion in the collection. At some point I will look into allowing others to upload to the collection, but the upload process is so finicky. I've written my own scripts and even those are a pain in the ass to use. And that is just with one person uploading.
