Radio Nowhere is the name I've given to a (hopefully) ongoing project of mine. The main idea behind this project is to get as many of Bruce Springsteen's concerts onto Archive.org as possible, while also maintaining a decent standard of quality throughout. Below I'll try to explain the project and as much of my reasoning as possible.

This project has been a long time coming, mainly trying to sort out the logistics and feasibility of such an insane project. I've had the idea for a good while now, but only now (May 2024) have started working towards actually doing it.

# Inspiration
The main inspiration for this project is the "Live Music Archive" (also on archive.org). That is a similar project to have tapes of bands like the Grateful Dead, Phish, etc. available for stream and download (when permitted) on Archive.org as well as sites like relisten.

But the LMA primarily focuses on trade-friendly and taper-friendly bands and artists. Bruce isn't either, which would prevent his inclusion in a project like the Live Music Archive. Taping his shows isn't technically allowed (tapers have been kicked out of shows in the past). But he also doesn't have a Peter Grant-like figure roaming venues to find tapers and destroy their equipment. Tapes/Bootlegs of his can and have been freely shared for many years, whether traded via snail mail, or shared on the internet.

Another inspiration for this project specifically is the Grateful Dead trading scene. Almost every show of theirs is available to stream and download (AUD only) on archive.org, and it's something I've wanted for the Bruce scene as well. Far as I know, a project like this hasn't been attempted in the past, at least not one on the scale I'm planning.

# Project Goal
As mentioned, the main goal of this project is to get as many of Bruce Springsteen's concerts onto Archive.org as possible. To start, the plan is to have one complete recording of each show. Preferably the highest quality recording that is circulating. This project will only focus on bootleg recordings, no official material will be part of this collection. 

Another document in this repo will go over the vague guidelines I'm aiming for, as well as properly organizing the files to show up right.

# Conclusion
If you've made it all this way through my extended ramble, well done I guess? This repo is pretty much just going to be documents pertaining to the project, the files themselves will be hosted on archive.org.
