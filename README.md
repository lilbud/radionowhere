## Project Goal
The main goal of this project is to provide a publicly available archive of Bruce Springsteen's concert recordings on archive.org. The initial goal is one tape per show, then maybe later down the road it could grow.

## Project Origins
As mentioned, this project started in early 2024, and was fully underway by May 21st when the Archive collection was created. The initial goal was to upload my sizable collection of Bruce bootlegs, and provide a hopefully long-term home for them. 

A project like this has been on my mind for a number of years now, for reasons which I'll explain more in a bit. The main thing stopping it until now was not having a place for it. I'd have to find somewhere to host the files, which would get pricey depending on how much space this ends up requiring. And this isn't even taking into account issues like the hoster going down forever or disabling the account. 

For those wondering, most sites charge between $5-15 per TB per month. I'm estimating that this will take at least 2TB of storage, possibly more if this continues past the "one tape per show" goal I'm aiming for. I suppose there are other options like a massive community torrent, or self-hosting on my own server. But those have pros/cons of their own as well, longevity and cost among them.

## Inspiration
The inspiration for this project came from the LiveMusicArchive (also on archive.org). That is a similar project, acting as a repository for tapes from bands like the Grateful Dead, Phish, and many others. These tapes are available to stream, as well as download in many cases.

But, and this is somewhat important, the LMA focuses on "taper-friendly" acts, those that allowed their fans to tape their shows. Bruce isn't among them, which would prevent his inclusion in something like the LMA. He has never allowed open taping of his shows, and tapers have been kicked out of shows for doing so. This hasn't stopped them, just made it harder to do so. Although, with every show from 2014 onwards being officially released on Nugs after the show, very few are bothering to tape. 

More specifically, I was inspired by the Grateful Dead trading community, who have tirelessly worked to have tapes of every single show of theirs freely available, without any caveats.
## Why?
As far as I'm aware, there hasn't ever been a project attempted like this, least of all on this scale, and definitely not openly. As it stands, there are a only a handful of places focused on sharing Bruce bootlegs. Each having their own issues and downsides.

All of them share the same core issue, they weren't designed to be permanent. They're all basically temporary, simply because that's how things go. Users come and go from these sites, files get deleted, seeders go offline, etc. Sites like GreasyLake and BTX (both of which have bootleg request threads) are dependent on those with collections to share what they have and fill requests. Most of the time, these files are uploaded temporarily, and removed after a period of time (whether due to the upload site, or the uploader.) 

Of course, the solution is just "upload everything forever", which is definitely feasible if you have the funds/cloud space, but not everyone does.
## Conclusion
After explaining the above, there's no way I can conclude this while claiming that Radio Nowhere is a perfect solution. It would be ridiculous to do so, this project is fully dependent on the Internet Archive as a platform. Last fall, they had an extended outage due to DDoS attacks that prevented access for over a month. I would hope that nothing like that would happen again, but it is simply unknown.

But, I like to think that this is a start. Perhaps it encourages someone else to start a similar initiative. Maybe that idea about a massive community torrent could happen, or possibly someone with the know-how/resources to host a cloud drive could do just that.
